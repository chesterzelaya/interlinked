we need a litmus test for the mind. 

a way to protect ourselves against the psyops and engineered narratives flooding the digital world.

the internet has never made it easier to push agendas. 

social media enables influence at scale, where a single data structure of content can shape the thoughts of millions.

artificial bias is taking the throne.

this litmus test keeps our minds in check.

monitored at the machine learning level, aware of any subtle shifts caused by simply participating and intaking digital culture.

the system watches through six pathways:

    ■ transcriber 

    ■ voice analysis 

    ■ sentiment analysis 

    ■ embeddings 

    ■ anomaly detection 

    ■ orchestration 

    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

baseline learning occurs through your first recordings. the system learns you before it can detect when you are no longer you.

multi modal self observation across voice, semantic, emotional, and linguistic dimensions.

    ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

run the system:

    ./interlinked.sh

go to http://127.0.0.1:8000 and take your daily test.

view analysis results:

    on the UI with "Analyze Latest Recording" button

    or

    cd NLP && python main.py
